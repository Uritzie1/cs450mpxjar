NAME
	dispat -- identify the next READY process, if any, and load its
		   context from its PCB

SYNOPSIS
	***NONE***

DESCRIPTION
	The dispat command identifies the next READY process, if any, and 	dispatches it by loading its context from its PCB.  Assuming that a 	PCB is found in the ready queue, the dispatcher must perform the 	following steps:
	
	1. Remove the first PCB from the READY queue.
	2. Set a pointer to this PCB identifying it as the RUNNING process.
	3. Copy the stack pointer from this PCB to the actual SP to prepare
	   for context restoration.
